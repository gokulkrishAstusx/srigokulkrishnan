    <h1>Hello.</h1>
    <p class="paraOne">My name is Sri Gokul Krishnan.</p>
    <p>I am a Chennai-based (India) Product Designer driven by an unwavering passion for the design field. Throughout my journey, I have embraced the invaluable lesson of iteration. Countless failures have only strengthened my resolve, as I firmly believe that continuous design, building, and testing are the cornerstones of improvement.</p>
    <p>Beyond my design pursuits, I find joy in various activities. Video games provide an immersive escape, street foods tantalize my taste buds, and riding my new Himalayan motorcycle fills me with exhilaration. </p>
